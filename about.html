    <h2>hi</h2>

    <p>
      <strong>what the fuck is going on in the world</strong>, how are so many people getting away 
      with being so shitty. it's kinda interesting that we've just accepted shitty behaviour aye
    </p>

    <p>
      welcome to my therapeautic venting outlet to raise awareness about actions or attitudes that 
      affect people, communities, or culture — whether they’re annoying, awful, or simply overdue 
      for accountability. but please stay for the occasional praise towards the good shit
    </p>

    <h3>Why “IDIOT BOY”?</h3>
    <p>
      The name is tongue-in-cheek. It reflects how obvious bad behaviour can look in hindsight —
      a reminder that we all have blind spots. The goal isn’t to insult, but to invite people 
      to do better.
    </p>

    <h3>Principles</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Evidence-based: Nothing without sources or proof.</li>
      <li>Legal and fair: No defamation, no hate speech, no personal attacks.</li>
      <li>Playful: Humour is allowed — malice isn’t.</li>
      <li><strong>Truth comes first:</strong> We don’t post rumours — only what we can verify, prove, or clearly state as opinion.</li>
      <li><strong>Public interest, not public drama:</strong> Everything here exists to question power and improve the conversation — not stir gossip.</li>
      <li><strong>Everyone gets a say:</strong> Anyone mentioned has the right to respond — no ambushes, no ghosting.</li>
      <li><strong>Opinions, not accusations:</strong> We say what we think, not what we can’t prove — and we make that distinction clear.</li>
      <li><strong>Receipts or it didn’t happen:</strong> Every claim comes with context, evidence, or sources. If we can’t back it, it won’t go up.</li>
      <li><strong>We own our mistakes:</strong> If something’s wrong, we fix it fast, apologise, and move on transparently.</li>
      <li><strong>No hate, no harassment:</strong> Criticism is aimed at actions — never identities. Disrespect doesn’t belong here.</li>
      <li><strong>Globally aware, locally grounded:</strong> We post for everyone, but play by the laws and ethics where we live.</li>
      <li><strong>Ask, don’t assume:</strong> We question decisions, not people’s worth. Questions keep everyone honest — including us.</li>
      <li><strong>Learning as we go:</strong> Accountability is a process — we evolve as the facts do.</li>
    </ul>
